## What is 1-OFF Games


1-Off Games is a fictional Canadian video game retailer, specializing in used and
        rare video games. They are a mid-sized chain of brick-and-mortar stores
        found in major cities throughout British Columbia and Alberta. Over the
        past decade they have seen consistent growth and expansion and until
        very recently did not have any reason to make any major changes. <br />
        <br />
        However, with both the advent of a devastating global health pandemic,
        and the steady loss in revenue the past couple of years from e-commerce
        giants such as Amazon, the company has decided that they require an
        online presence at once to continue operations.<br />
        <br />
        The company has contracted our team to design, develop and deploy a
        fully functioning e-commerce website so that they can sell their
        products directly to consumers. After a few meetings, our team reviewed
        the client’s requirements, and determined that everything could be
        implemented within an eight-week deadline.<br />
        <br />
        The backend for this system will use MySQL, with PHP middleware
        dynamically controlling the content. The web content will be hosted via
        Apache web server. The look and feel of the site will be handled by the
        Bootstrap CSS framework.
        
        
## Problems & Challenges

There were some growing pains related to learning PHP, a large one being
        that a script will continue to run despite being redirected if there is
        no exit function called, which resulted in difficult to diagnose errors
        that seemed unrelated to the script that appeared to be causing them.
        Another issue with PHP which came up more than once, was the confusion
        around how the function to return SQLi data handled the data, and not
        realizing that the item is removed from the queue when passed to that
        function.<br>
        <br>
        Communication was also a small issue day to day, with morning meetings
        starting late due to issues with audio hardware and software. These were
        usually minor, however it resulted in a 5 to 15-minute delays many days,
        despite being ‘fixed’ the day prior. While it had negligible impact on
        this project, in a professional environment it seems unlikely this
        number of technical issue related delay would be tolerated, and a more
        time-constrained project might have difficulty if this remained a common
        issue.<br>
        <br>
         The team had minor issues with cross communication between scripts as
        well, with strange decisions for what data type to use for certain data
        that may be used at many points of the project, or using a new variable
        name to refer to a value that was already under a different name, and
        may be utilized in other scripts. These issues ended up being minor, as
        all team members were available and present to explain why their script
        may be acting unexpectedly because of the values passed to it.<br>
        <br>
         Occasionally it was difficult to articulate a question about others code
        or process, due to the remote nature of the project. We had to make
        heavy use of the Snipping feature to send images to each other, when if
        done in person, they could simply be shown right in the code.
        Semi-frequent in-person meet ups would make the project easier and
        smooth in a few situations, however over all the team managed to find a
        way to work around this limitation with little difficulty.
        
## Skills Learned

During this Project, our team had the opportunity to practice with our
      current skills and learn new ones such as our:
      
### Soft Skills

We were able to improve our less used skills such as our online
        communication and time management skills which were less developed until
        now. The skills that were reinforced during this project were our
        collaboration skills, problem solving skills, researching skills and our
        critical thinking skills. The most important skills that we had to
        depend on for this project were our online communication, time
        management, and our collaboration skills. These skills were particularly
        important for this project because we were unable to meet in person and
        thus, we had to talk using digital means and had to keep our selves
        accountable due to the situation outside of our control (COVID-19
        pandemic).
        
### Technical Skills

We were able to learn some new tools and languages such as php, Stripe,
        XAMPP, Microsoft project, and Adobe XD. We also had the opportunity to
        improve our skills with Bootstrap, JavaScript, website design, database
        management, HTML and CSS. The tool that we had the most trouble learning
        to use was Microsoft project, that was because we had to access this
        piece of software through a remote desk. The most important technical
        skills we had to learn for this project was php, Microsoft Project, and
        XAMPP. The use of these skills allowed use to effectively plan, create,
        and test this project.
